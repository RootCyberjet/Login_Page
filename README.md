# Login_Page :
These are simple HTML &amp; PHP codes for login page to study how the back-end of a login-page works.

# Requirements :
First install xampp control panel and configure it. Then copy these codes to the xampp/htdocs folder. After that open your any browser and put the URL http://localhost:8080/login.php and press enter.
For succesfully login you have to create a database. you can do it by phpmyadmin. To do that, put the URL http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/ in your browser and press enter, then you can creat database there. For my case, I create a database named "phonebook" with table name "userdata" where I store usernames and their corresponding password hashes.
